# Introduction

## What is VIP Search?

VIP Search is a solution to allow the usage of Elasticsearch to provide both a search solution and a performance-enhancing layer existing WordPress search and queries.

Currently this means a fork of ElasticPress provides Elasticsearch indexing and search while a fork of es-wp-query provides query offloading capabilities via a VIP Search adapter.

The goal is to replace all other search and query offloading solutions currently in use on the VIP Go Platform with VIP Search.
