## Local development

The easiest way to develop this plugin locally is by using the `wp-env` package. [It is an official WP.org package](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) that spins up a Docker-based WordPress environment for plugin development.

Having Docker running,

```
npm install

# Start the environment
npm run dev:start

# Stop the environment
npm run dev:stop
```

This will start up an environment in `localhost:8888`, running in the background.

To develop for WordPress VIP sites, we recommend using [the WordPress VIP dev-env](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-local-development-environment/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where do I find my Site ID?

Your Site ID is likely your own site domain name (e.g., `mysite.com`). You can find this in your Parse.ly account.

### Why can't I see Parse.ly code on my post when I preview?

The code will only be placed on posts and pages which have been published in WordPress to ensure we don't track traffic generated while you're still writing a post or page.

You may also be not tracking logged-in users, via one of the settings.

### How can I edit the values passed to the JSON-LD metadata?

You can use the `wp_parsely_metadata` filter, which sends three arguments: the array of metadata, the post object, and the `parsely_options` array:

    add_filter( 'wp_parsely_metadata', 'filter_parsely_metadata', 10, 3 );
    function filter_parsely_metadata( $parsely_metadata, $post, $parsely_options ) {
        $parsely_metadata['articleSection'] = '...'; // Whatever values you want Parse.ly's Section to be.
        return $parsely_metadata;
    }

This filter can go anywhere in your codebase, provided it always gets loaded.

### Is the plugin compatible with AMP and Facebook Instant Articles?

It is! The plugin hooks into Automattic's official plugins for [AMP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/) and [Facebook Instant Articles](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fb-instant-articles/).

AMP support is enabled automatically if the Automattic AMP plugin is installed

For Facebook Instant Articles support, enable "Parsely Analytics" in the "Advanced Settings" menu of the Facebook Instant Articles plugin.

### Does the plugin support dynamic tracking?

This plugin does not currently support dynamic tracking (the tracking of multiple pageviews on a single page).

Some common use-cases for dynamic tracking are slideshows or articles loaded via AJAX calls in single-page applications -- situations in which new content is loaded without a full page refresh.

Tracking these events requires manually implementing additional JavaScript above [the standard Parse.ly include](http://www.parsely.com/help/integration/basic/) that the plugin injects into your page source. Please consult [the Parse.ly documentation on dynamic tracking](https://www.parsely.com/help/integration/dynamic/) for instructions on implementing dynamic tracking, or contact Parse.ly support for additional assistance.

### Cloudflare support

If the site is running behind a Cloudflare DNS, their Rocket Loader technology will alter how JavaScript files are loaded. [A JavaScript file can be ignored by Rocket Loader](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169436-How-can-I-have-Rocket-Loader-ignore-specific-JavaScripts) by using `data-cfasync="false"`.

Previous versions of this plugin would mark all scripts with that tag by default. Starting in version 3.0, that behavior has become optional and scripts won't be annotated with `data-cfasync="false"`. The previous behavior can be restored by adding the following filter:

```
add_filter( 'wp_parsely_enable_cfasync_attribute', '__return_true' );
```
