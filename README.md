# VIP Go mu-plugins

This is the development repo for mu-plugins on [VIP Go](http://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip-go/),

## Development

### PHPDoc

You can find selective PHPDoc documentation here: https://automattic.github.io/vip-go-mu-plugins/

These are generated via CI by the [`generate-docs.sh`]() script.

### Tests

#### PHP Lint

```bash
make lint
```

#### PHPUnit

Running automated tests requires a working WordPress development environment.

Here's how to do so using [VVV](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/):

1. Set up VVV and your vagrant environment

2. Navigate to your `wp-content` folder and clone this repo into `mu-plugins`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins.git mu-plugins
```

3. SSH into your box and navigate to the `mu-plugins` folder:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
vagrant@vvv:~$cd /path/to/wp-content/mu-plugins
```

4. Setup the WordPress tests:

```bash
vagrant@vvv:
vagrant@vvv:/wp-content/mu-plugins$ ./bin/install-wp-tests.sh %empty_DB_name% %db_user% %db_name%
```

Note: you need to replace the `%placeholder%` strings above with the appropriate values. Use a separate test database for this as the contents will get trashed during testing.

5. Install dependencies

Note: need to have composer pre-installed.

```bash
composer install
```

6. Run tests:

```bash
vagrant@vvv:/wp-content/mu-plugins$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```

#### Travis

PHP Linting and PHPUnit tests are also run by Travis as part of PRs and merges. See the `script` section of [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins/blob/master/.travis.yml).

## Deployment

### Production

**For Automattic Use:** Instructions are in the FG :)

### vip-go-mu-plugins-built

This is a repo primarily meant for local non-development use. It e

Every commit merged into `master` is automatically pushed to the public copy at [Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins-built](https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins-built/). This is handled via CI by the [`deploy.sh` script](https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins/blob/master/ci/deploy.sh) script, which builds pushes a copy of this repo and expanded submodules.

#### How this works

1. The private part of a deploy key for [Automattic/vip-mu-plugins-built](https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins-built/) is encrypted against this repository ([Automattic/vip-mu-plugins-built](https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins/)), meaning it can only be decrypted by Travis running scripts related to this repo
2. This repository and it's submodules are checked out, again, to start the build
3. All VCS config and metadata is removed from the build
4. Various files are removed, including the [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins/blob/master/.travis.yml) containing the encrypted private part of the deploy key
5. The [Automattic/vip-mu-plugins-built](https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins-built/) repo is checked out
6. The `.git` directory from the `Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins-built` repository is moved into the build directory, and a commit is created representing the changes from this build
7. The commit is pushed to the `Automattic/vip-go-mu-plugins-built` repository
