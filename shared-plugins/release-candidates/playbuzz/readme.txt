== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I embed content from the Playbuzz network? =
Our content is created by our network of partners, our community of users and our editorial staff. We feature highly engaging items around many popular topics. Embedding these items on your site is likely to boost all of your engagement and performance metrics: page views, ad impressions, time on page, time on site, pages per visit, social media share rates and more. Above all, these items enhance your site’s content offering an extremely engaging and viral way.

= Can Playbuzz help my site to go viral? =
Absolutely! We obviously can’t guarantee that you’ll get millions of page views, but our content platform is optimized to encourage maximum sharing. Embeds powered by our plugin include the option to share each content item on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Any click on these share buttons will create a share link directing users to your website.

= Does Playbuzz work on mobile and tablet versions of my site? =
Yes. Playbuzz's UI is responsive and mobile compatible.

= Can I create my own content? =
For sure. And the plugin makes it super easy to find your own creations in a dedicated tab interface. We encourage you to use our free platform to create original Playful Content here: https://www.playbuzz.com/create

= Might this plugin slow down my website? =
Nope. Test it and see for yourself. Playbuzz uses a large content delivery network to ensure super-fast load times.

= How do I embed Playbuzz content? =
The WordPress plugin supports two ways to embed Playbuzz content: For basic use, you can search for content from within the plugin, or embed content you’ve already found simply by pasting its [Playbuzz.com](https://www.playbuzz.com) URL into the text editor. Advanced users can use Playbuzz shortcodes using attributes to customize embed settings.

= I’m using an older version of WordPress, and I have a lot of plugins installed. I’ve upgraded the Playbuzz plugin, but some of the features seem to not be working. What should I do? =
To work around this issue, go to the Plugins panel, click “Deactivate” under the Playbuzz plugin, re-activate the plugin, and you should be all set.
