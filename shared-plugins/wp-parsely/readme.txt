== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I find my Site ID? =

Head to [your settings screen](http://dash.parsely.com/to/settings/api?highlight=apikey) and copy the value for Site ID.

= Why can't I see Dash code on my post when I preview? =

Dash code will only be placed on pages and posts which have been published in WordPress to ensure we don't track traffic generated while you're still writing a post/page.
