= Why we do this? =

At UppSite we believe that web publishers of all sorts (i.e. anyone with a website) deserve the best mobile presence. Why? Because we also believe that consuming web content on mobile devices should be effortless and engaging. 

Mobile has significantly changed how people consume content these days. More and more we attempt to access and consume content from our smart mobile devices (whether smartphones, such as iPhone or an Android device, or tablets, such as iPad). However, mobile is a new form factor and users expect to enjoy seamless experiences extending the functionality and UI design that is characteristic to their devices. Shrinking websites to fit a mobile screen is simply not enough. In the mobile era publishers and content creators should, so we believe, engage with their audiences in a mobile way. 

True, going mobile is normally a tedious task that requires significant investments and dealings with many outlets and providers to get your app out on the market. Gladly, this is not the case with UppSite. We’ve set out to bridge the mobile gap for all publishers by providing a dead-simple and fast solution to turn a site into a mobile application, without compromising the quality of the end result. From creation and publication to maintenance and upgrades we make this process as easy as it gets, and as affordable as you could only imagine. Our apps (native & webapp), although created in a matter minutes deliver all the features and functionality that you’d expect from the most cutting-edge apps out there, and cater to the needs of publishers of all sizes.
