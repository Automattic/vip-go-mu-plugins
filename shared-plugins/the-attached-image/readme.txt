The Attached Image is a simple plugin that packs quite a punch. It shows the first image attached to the current post. It was inspired by a plugin wrote by Kaf Oseo, but when support was stopped &amp; a recent upgrade of WordPress meant it didn't work exactly like it used to I decided to take on the challenge of remaking it using the new WordPress functions available.

== Description ==

The Attached Image is a simple plugin that packs quite a punch. It shows the first image attached to the current post. It was inspired by a plugin wrote by Kaf Oseo, but when support was stopped &amp; a recent upgrade of WordPress meant it didn't work exactly like it used to I decided to take on the challenge of remaking it using the new WordPress functions available.

Features include an options page to easily customise how the plugin works, the ability to override those options through the use of legacy parameters entered via a fairly friendly query string system. All the plugin requires is that you call it within the loop.

There are limited instructions of how to install this plugin here on WordPress.org under the installation tab. It is however advisable to check the detailed installation instructions provided a my [website](http://return-true.com/2008/12/wordpress-plugin-the-attached-image/ "Full installation instructions & more info")
