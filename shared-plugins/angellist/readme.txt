Add AngelList company profiles to your posts.

== Description ==

Associate an individual post with one or more [AngelList](http://angel.co/) companies to automatically display company logo, summary, description, key people, and more after your post content.

The plugin generates HTML markup for posts with associated companies. Company profiles are cached on your server for fast access without remote requests to AngelList servers with each page load.

Includes [Schema.org markup](http://schema.org/) for rich company metadata and search engine friendliness.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I disable Schema.org markup from appearing on my page? =

[HTML5 microdata](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html) may cause undesired results for some document types and theme markup. Tap into the `angellist_schema_org` [filter](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter "WordPress add_filter function") from your theme's `functions.php` file or one of your site's custom plugins to override the default `true` state and disable Schema.org and its microdata output.

= How do I change the target attribute generated by AngelList links? =

Links to AngelList pages open in a new window by default through a `_blank` [browsing context](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/browsers.html#valid-browsing-context-name-or-keyword). XHTML themes may dislike the `target` attributes on anchor elements. Tap into the `angellist_browsing_context` [filter](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter "WordPress add_filter function") from your theme's `functions.php` file or one of your site's custom plugins to override this default context with another valid context name. Return an empty string (`''`) to remove the attribute.

= I run a high-traffic site. I think I have been rate limited =

The [AngelList API](http://angel.co/api) allows up to 1000 requests per hour bucketed by IP. A single company may consume three API requests (company data + people data + jobs data) while generating the necessary markup, effectively limiting sites to 333 generated company profiles per hour.

If you run into rate limiting issues you may consider bumping your transient cache times for each company. You may also [contact the AngelList API team](mailto:api@angel.co) to raise the limits for your server IP addresses.

== Screenshots ==

1. Search AngelList by company name, add one or more companies, and reorder to add context to your posts.
2. Display one or more claimed or community-generated company profiles after your post content.
